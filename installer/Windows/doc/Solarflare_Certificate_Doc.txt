============================================ Steps for CA Signed Certificate ===============================================

1) Obtain and install the Windows SDK from Microsoft.

2) Obtain the code signing certificate from the CA in .pxf format(PRIVATECERT_PATH).

3) Note the password used to protect the code signing certificate when transferred from the CA(PRIVATECERT_PASSWORD).

4) Obtain the URL for the time stamping server used by the issuing CA(TIMESERVER_URL).

5) Note the full path to the signtool.exe application, located to the bin directory of the Windows SDK installed in Step 1 above(SIGNTOOL_PATH).

6) Note the directory where the edited msi package is located (MSI_PATH).

7) Create the signing command using the following, with appropriate values:
